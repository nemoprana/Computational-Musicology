# Computational-Musicology
project for the course Computational Musicology

and this is a new line! !!!!

I will be comparing two corpuses:

On one hand a playlist featuring all the songs of my dad's repertoire; this includes all the songs of the bands 'Mad Stream' and 'Sleepers Awake At Night'.

On the other hand the playlist called 'radio SAAN' which is a playlist featuring (I believe) songs that the drummer of the two previously mentioned bands thinks aligns with their music.

 

What I am looking at here is basically a comparison of the sound of the band versus what they think they sound like. Because I personally know the people I can (and will) check if the playlist is exactly for that purpose, but for now I assume it is. 

A song I found intriguing in the playlist for example is 'Tour de France' by Kraftwerk. As the bands mostly play psychedelic rock, the more electronic side came as a surprise. I can fully understand the link however. 

The bands SAAN and Mad Stream are almost the same bands, only differing by a member and the time wherein they played. Maybe making a small comparison between these two might also yield interesting results.


The graph (called tempo_valence_track.album.name) contains data from the playlist containing the full repetoire of all the saan and madstream songs. They are plotted out with x = tempo, y = valene and color = track.album.name. The graph is a quick check to see if there is any correlation between tempo and valence, but it turns out that most of the songs just have a high valence so there is not too much to be seen :).
